# Developer portfolio as a 2D game

Inspired by the many creative 3D developer portfolios, I create one that's 2D instead.
This is meant as a template that you can use to build your own. It works on both desktop
and mobile.

I want to thank [JSLegendDev](https://github.com/JSLegendDev) as I was able to make my version by watching his repo and video.

Watch the tutorial I made on how to build this on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwtfWORCN0U)

JSLegendDev has used a modified version of this original tileset (Giving credit where it's due): [Link](https://momen-games.itch.io/happy-la-v2-ts)
